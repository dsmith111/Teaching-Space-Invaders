Hello, this zip file contains the deliverables of Sonia Patel, and David Smith's
project ECE-554 final project
========================

*C-Sharp-Scripts

This folder contains .cs files consisting of all of the classes we have developed for the project.
Each of these classes also contain the functions that we have wrote, or used.
Each .cs file is organized into sub-folders based on their category.

=========================

*Sprites

This folder contains the images of the sprites we drew for the game. We created the sprites, but their design is from the game
Space Invaders.

=========================

*Teaching-Space-Invaders

This is the actual compiled version of our game. The unity engine compresses all of the scripts, sprites and other assets into
easier to transfer files. This will contain an executable for a windows operating system, but one will not be able to find any
discrete file, such as a .cs.
